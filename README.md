# My Reads App
This is a 7th project of Google Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Scholarship at Udacity. 

### App Functionality
My Reads app was build with React. It is a bookshelf app that allows user to select and categorize books. The main page displays a list of "shelves" (i.e. categories), each of which contains a number of books. The three shelves are:
- Currently Reading
- Want to Read
- Read

Each book has a control that lets select the shelf. Default value for the control is the current shelf the book is in. There is also an option of "search" which allows the user to choose a book and place it at a preferred shelf.

### How to get started:
* clone or download the project
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

#### Code Dependencies
The project was based on the Udacity starter code https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter
